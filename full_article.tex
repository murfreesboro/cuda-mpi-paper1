This is a LaTeX template designed for use by the \textbf{International Journal of Quantum Chemistry}. Please consult the journal's author guidelines in order to confirm that your manuscript complies with the journal's requirements. When you are ready to submit your manuscript, download/export it in LaTeX or Word format and submit your document at \href{https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/qua}{https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/qua}.

\section{First Level Heading}
Please lay out your article using the section headings and example objects below, and remember to delete all help text prior to submitting your article to the journal.

\subsection{Second Level Heading}
If data, scripts or other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the article are available via a publicly available data repository, please include a reference to the location of the material within the article.

This is an equation, numbered

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:some}
\int_0^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}

And one that is not numbered

\begin{equation*}
e^{i\pi}=-1
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Adding Citations and a References List}

You can cite bibliographic entries easily in Authorea. For example, a couple of citations follow \cite{Cavalleri_2016}. By default citations are formatted according to the IJQC format, but you can change that in the Export Options \cite{Meskine_2019}

\subsubsection{Customizing the exported PDF}
You can add packages, create aliases and macros (newcommands), as well as specify corresponding address, corresponding email, funding information etc by clicking "Settings", "Edit Macros".

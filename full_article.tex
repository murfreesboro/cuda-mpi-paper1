\section{Introduction of four-centers integrals for Coulomb and exchange}


 
In quantum chemistry the basis functions are fundamental to a molecular QM calculation. Here
in this our discussion is focused on the Cartesian Gaussian form of functions: 
\begin{equation}\label{work:1}
         \chi = x^{i}y^{j}z^{k}e^{-\alpha r^{2}} \quad \text{.}
\end{equation}
In practice a basis function $\phi$ is generally a linear combination of Cartesian 
Gaussian functions:
\begin{equation}\label{work:2}
         \phi = \sum_{n}d_{n}\chi_{n} \quad \text{,}
\end{equation}
where the coefficient $d_{n}$ is an pre-optimized constant. Upon the Gaussian form basis functions, The fundamental Coulomb and HF exchange energies can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:1}
         E_{Coulomb}  &= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu\nu}P_{\mu\nu}
 \sum_{\lambda\eta}P_{\lambda\eta}\int dr dr^{'}\frac{\phi_{\mu}(r)\phi_{\nu}(r)
 \phi_{\lambda}(r^{'})\phi_{\eta}(r^{'})} {|r - r^{'}|} \nonumber \\
         E_{Exchange} &= -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu\nu}P_{\mu\nu}
 \sum_{\lambda\eta}P_{\lambda\eta}\int dr dr^{'}\frac{\phi_{\mu}(r)\phi_{\lambda}(r)
 \phi_{\nu}(r^{'})\phi_{\eta}(r^{'})} {|r - r^{'}|} \quad \text{.}
\end{align}
$r$ and $r^{'}$ characterize the positions for the two electrons.
$\phi$ is a basis function, and $\mu$, $\nu$, $\lambda$ and $\eta$ are the
indexes for the basis functions. $P_{\mu\nu}$ is the density
matrix.

The computation the Coulomb and HF exchange becomes the most time-consuming
part in QM applications is because the electron repulsion integral(ERI) in Eq.
\ref{eq:1} involves four indexes, so theoretically it generally scales as
$N^{4}$ (N is the size of basis functions).  Furthermore since each basis
function is also a contraction of Gaussian functions, such ERI calculation
actually involves eight loops. 

In practice the computation of ERI is usually performed on shell-quartet,
where all of ERIs coming from the same four-shell set are calculated together
so that to save the computational cost. The shell-quartet is usually abbreviated 
as $(ab|cd)$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ etc. represent the general shells data on
the positions of $\mu$, $\nu$, $\lambda$ and $\eta$ in Eq. \ref{eq:1}.
In particular we usually use ``0'' to represent the S shell($L=0$). For example,
$(e0|f0)$ means the shells data on $\nu$ and $\eta$ positions are S type of shells.

The most efficient algorithm for directly performing ERI calculation is to use
recurrence relations\cite{gill1994molecular}, and the HGP algorithm\cite{HGP}
provides the most efficient recurrence relations for the general ERI
derivation.  The calculation of ERI in the HGP algorithm can be general divided
into two steps.  The first step is to perform vertical recurrence
relations(VRR) which transform the directly computed auxiliary integrals
$(00|00)^{m}$ into the shell-quartets in the form of $(e0|f0)$.  The second step is
to conduct horizontal recurrence relations(HRR), and in this step the intermediate
shell-quartets $(e0|f0)$ will be finally transformed to result shell-quartet
$(ab|cd)$.

Generally the cost of ERI calculation(approximated FLOPS cost) scales at
$(L+1.39)^{8}$\cite{shao2000improved}.  Due to such rapid increase of the cost
the implementation of ERI on the MIC platform is needed to be divided into two
parts. The first part is the implementation for low angular momentum basis
functions including those in S, P and D types.  The second part is for basis
functions with angular momentum higher than D.

\section{GPU implementation of four-centers integrals}

For the ERIs in \ref{eq:1} the traditional way on CPU is to compute all of integrals together in the same shell quartet. For example the shell quartet $(PP|PP)$ is composed by four $P$ shells and it consists of 81 ERIs. The benefit to compute ERIs through the shell quartet is to save FLOPS since different ERIs in the same shell quartet may share the intermediate results during the integral computation. 

For GPU implementation because of the limitted resource of register and L1 cache
